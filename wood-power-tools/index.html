    <!-- CATEGORY INTRO -->
    <section class="info-section category-intro">
      <p>The equipment under this category is used primarily for processing wood and are powered with electricity. Some of this equipment is large and stationary, while other pieces are smaller and portable.</p>

      <p>In general, plastic material can be processed on this equipment. Usually, adjustments do NOT need to be made to the equipment in order to work plastic material instead of wood on them with the following exceptions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Table saws -- the plastics blade, hanging on the wall behind the chop saw, should be used to increase blade life and obtain a higher quality of cut.</li>
        <li>Band saws -- just be sure you are using a blade with 6 TPI or more. In general, blades with smaller and more numerous teeth are better.</li>
        <li>Chop saw -- NEVER CUT PLASTIC WITH THE CHOP SAW -- MANY PLASTICS WILL SHATTER.</li>
        <li>All -- plastic melts when it gets hot. Be sure to continue to feed material into a blade, or continually move it against a sander when processing it.</li>
      </ul>

        <p>The wire at the T1U connector on the variable frequency drive (VFD) going to the motor on the dust collector fan was discovered burnt after three or four episodes in which the dust collector would simply shut down on its own.  The first occurance was on 11/7/25.  The VFD controller had the two error messages shown here in the photos.  Also shown here in the photos is the burned T1/U terminal screw.  The wire leads are taped up in the picture, but the one going to this terminal has burnt insulation.</p>

        <p>The dust collector was put back in operation.  On 11/17, the first replacement VFD was put into surface and immediately shorted.  A second VFD replacement was aquired.  Before this one was placed in service, the motor was meggered and checked for shorts.  No shorts were found.  It is thought that the first replacement VFD was faulty.</p>
